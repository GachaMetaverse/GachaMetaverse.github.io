                    You must meet the minimum age requirement for Discord within your country. Claiming to be younger, even as a joke, will result in a ban.

                    Any threat or joke about raiding, doxxing, or swatting someone will result in a permanent ban. Sharing doxxing information is also considered a bannable offense, even if you are trying to make mods aware of it. When in doubt, create a ticket.

                    Sending viruses or malware goes against Discord's Terms of Service, and we will ban you if we find out you have sent or participated in them in or out of the server. For the sake of simplicity, IP grabbers are also not allowed.

                    Recording VCs without consent is frowned upon in the server, therefore we do not allow it. We also abide by California state law, and so did you upon accepting Discord's privacy policy. You need consent from everyone in the VC if you are going to record the VC. The only exceptions to this rule are the stages hosted by the owners, which we do allow.

Members who try to converse or send media to other members with the intent of flirting/hitting on/rizzing up, whether a joke or not, will be punished. This also includes coming into the server with the intent of looking for people to flirt with or baiting people (“I like older men” “Any cute girls here?”).

This rule also floats under Rule 2.3. If you flirt with someone and they end up being a minor, you will be banned.

Spamming in VC includes: excessive use of soundboards, screaming into the mic, join/leaving quickly, and voice changers/TTS that irritate members. Sending one singular message meant to fill up the chat is called flooding and is also considered as spam.

                    If your message gets blocked, it was because it was blocked by automod.

This is known as an automod bypass, and you will be punished for it. We have words blocked for a reason. Yes, words known as brain rot such as sigma, skibidi, and gyatt are blocked. This was implemented due to the words being used to annoy members and lack of being used in a normal context.
